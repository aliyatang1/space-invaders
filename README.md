## Description
This is a game where a player's objective is to shoot _"Invaders"_ as they move closer to the player. To get the highscore, the player must shoot as many Invaders as possible. Each Invader shot gives the player more points for their _"Score"_.  
  Once all Invaders on the screen have been shot, the player advances to the next level, where the Invaders move faster. There are an infinite amount of levels (But good luck getting past level 4).  
  When a player is shot by an Invader or the Invaders make it all the way to the player, the player loses one of his three lives. If a player loses all three lives, its _"GAME OVER"_. Once the game is over the player moves to the High Score screen and if they have achieved a High Score, they are prompted to put their initials in for their score to be saved.
  The skinniest Invaders, at the back of the pack, shoot projectiles at the player. Each level, one of these Invaders will emit a power-up when he is shot by the player. Power ups give the player a special ability for 30 seconds.
